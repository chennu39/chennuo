    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Inquiry About Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - You requested assistance with confirming missing values in a dataset from a specific URL using Python’s Pandas library. I provided a code snippet to check for missing values using `df.isna().sum()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Request for Summary of Rows and Columns**:\n",
    "   - You asked for code to find the number of rows and columns in the dataset. I provided a method using `df.shape` to retrieve that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Definitions of Dataset Terms**:\n",
    "   - You requested definitions of \"observation\" and \"variables\" in the context of your dataset. I explained that observations correspond to rows, whereas variables correspond to columns in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Summarizing Columns with Code**:\n",
    "   - You asked for an example of how to provide a simple summary of the columns in the dataset. I provided code using `df.describe()` to summarize numerical and categorical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explaining Non-Numeric Variables**:\n",
    "   - You wanted clarification on what non-numeric variables are. I defined non-numeric variables as those that contain categorical data or text rather than numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Difference Between Attributes and Methods**:\n",
    "   - You inquired about the difference between an \"attribute\" and a \"method.\" I explained the distinction, emphasizing that attributes (e.g., `df.shape`) do not require parentheses, while methods (e.g., `df.describe()`) do.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Case for `df.dropna()`**:\n",
    "   - You asked for an example where using `df.dropna()` might be preferred over `del df['col']`. I provided a scenario illustrating that `df.dropna()` is useful for retaining information in other columns while removing incomplete rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Opposite Use Case for `del df['col']`**:\n",
    "   - You requested an opposite use case, where using `del df['col']` is more appropriate than `df.dropna()`. I explained a situation where removing an irrelevant column is beneficial for clarity and performance in analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Importance of Order: `del df['col']` Before `df.dropna()`**:\n",
    "   - You asked why applying `del df['col']` before `df.dropna()` could be important. I discussed benefits such as reducing complexity, improving performance, and avoiding unintended deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Code to Remove All Missing Data**:\n",
    "    - You requested a code example for removing all missing data from the dataset by applying `del df['name']` before `df.dropna()`. I provided the relevant code to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **KeyError Issue**:\n",
    "    - You encountered a `KeyError` when trying to delete the `name` column. I suggested checking the DataFrame's columns and provided code to prevent the error by confirming the column’s existence before deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Request for Summary of Interactions**:\n",
    "    - Finally, you requested a summary of our exchanges to submit as a record of our interactions for homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can not generate a link\n"

    "   - An `HTTPError` indicating a 404 issue when trying to access a dataset URL. I corrected the URL for the Titanic dataset.\n",

    "3. **DataFrame Operations**: You subsequently attempted group operations but encountered other errors including:\n",
    "   - A `SyntaxError` due to incomplete input caused by unclosed parentheses in the `pd.read_csv()` method. I emphasized the need for complete code lines.\n",
    "   - A `NameError` when referring to an undefined DataFrame variable `df`. I clarified that you should use the variable `titanic_df`.\n",
    "   - A `KeyError` when referencing non-existent columns ('cake' and 'candy'). I suggested checking actual DataFrame column names with `print(titanic_df.columns)` and using valid names.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Corrections**: You experienced a `NameError` due to misreferencing the column `age` without quotes. I provided corrected code with proper quotation usage for the column names.\n",
